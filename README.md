This C program is a raw implementation of Vogel's approximation method and a student project.
It's designed to calculate the initial basic feasible solution to a transportation problem.

You need to put your transportation problem into a text file named "tpfile.txt" to get the solution.
The program's output is in Russian. I guess I'll revise it later and add a few more languages.
